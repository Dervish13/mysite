First blog post, huh. It took me some time to do it since I was never really good with small talk.

So, I have decided to generalize this post, who am I and what can you expect to find here.

I am yet another I.T. person doing I.T. stuff. I have few ideas in my mind, that will find their place here as blog posts.
From doing simple hardware electronics, to doing security research, CTF write ups, system administration, programming.
Basically whatever I do, if it has any knowledge worth sharing, it will be found here.

I hunt for knowledge, and now it is time to share what I catch along the way. That is I guess my goal for this, to log knowledge.

Why listen to me you ask?

Why am I worth for you to follow and read what I have to say?

Whether you decide to read or not, it is up to you. If we have similar interests, you might be able to have a good read, or contact me if I can learn something from you.
Until next time, hopefully with some real content.
